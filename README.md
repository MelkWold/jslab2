`Java Script Lab 2 Assignment`

``This document contains the codes to answer the programming challenge for lab 2. ``

`Part 1: Growing Pains`
Instruction : Your task is to create a program that advises a group of environmental scientists how to handle the growth and spread of a unique plant species under their supervision. You must develop a growth control system that will monitor and predict the plant growth, making decisions based on the available space and potential growth.
`` Target ``
Using this information, your objectives are to:
1. Predict the plant growth after a specific number of weeks.
2. Implement control flow to make decisions on whether the plants should be:
    Pruned, to stop them from exceeding the capacity of the garden. This condition should be met if the plant count after the given number of weeks is greater than 80% of the maximum capacity of the garden.
    Monitored, if they are growing at an acceptable rate. This condition should be met if the plant count is between 50% and 80% of the maximum capacity of the garden after the given number of weeks.
    Planted, if there is room to plant more plants. This condition should be met if the plant count after the given number of weeks is less than 50% of the maximum capacity of the garden.

` Part 2: Thinking Bigger`
    The conservation area in which the garden is located has multiple other gardens. Using the logic you have already created, determine:
    1. The amount of additional space that would be required if the scientists were to start with 100 plants, and did not prune them for 10 weeks.
    2. If the space remained circular, what would be the radius of this expanded garden?

`Part 3: Errors in Judgement`
